    rules: {
      "featurefence/no-unsupported-feature": ["warn", {
        mode: "baseline-or-targets",

      }]

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: notice how each code block is opened with three backticks **and closed with three backticks**. That‚Äôs the main fix you were missing.  

üëâ If you copy this as-is, your page will render perfectly:  
- Headings (`##`) look correct  
- Code blocks are highlighted  
- CSS and nav are included  

Would you like me to now do the **same cleanup for your `index.md`, `examples.md`, and `faq.md`** so none of them break like this?
